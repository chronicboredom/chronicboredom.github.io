title: on the prevalence of and problems with shock humour.

Since the creation of this blog was at least partially (read: entirely) the result of boredom, I suppose I should start by discussing something I am particularly bored of.
That thing, if you didn't read the title all the way through (for which I don't blame you), is shock humour.

"Meme culture" has created a wave of edgy, taboo-pushing "comedy" that is inundanting practically every public forum and social media site.
If I were a proponent of this type of humour, I might describe it as "cancer": slowly and uncontrollably spreading from website to website, reducing communities to pale, spluttering shadows of their former selves.
People often ridicule use of the word "toxic", but I think it quite aptly describes the effect that edginess has on the internet.
My disdain for this type of comedy is naturally due to personal preference, but since a paragraph long pathos-infused indictment of something I don't like wouldn't make for a particularly interesting read I will attempt to rationalise my feelings and explain, with the aid of a thesaurus, why a genre of humour doesn't appeal to me.

Edgy jokes, in the form that they usually appear online, are akin to jumpscares in horror movies.
They evoke an emotional response in an audience, but said response quickly dissipates and leaves nothing in its place.
Without the shock there is no substance, and the rate at which the shock subsides increases as the phenomenon becomes more prevalent.
In this regard, edgy comedy is likely less effective than its horror movie homologue, as the response it exploits is rooted in culture rather than nature.
As taboos are broken they usually begin to disappear, and with them goes the "joke" of shock humour.

Some shock humourists respond to these criticisms by denying the importance of the joke itself, arguing that the comedy comes from the response.
As well as excusing lazy jokewriting, the stance acts as a barrier against criticism; anyone who points out legitimate flaws in their act is just a hypersensitive SJW.
Even if the claim were to be considered sincerely, it would be quite a weak defense given that the reactions of people to offensive humour are predictable and get old as quickly as their jokes.
That being said, I think there is some truth to what they are saying, though their way of phrasing it is a little disingenuous.
The reason, I imagine, that edgy humour is becoming so popular is because of the attention it can bring.

When you are an internet personality, no publicity is bad publicity.
Attention is what earns you money; it doesn't matter what feelings those providing it harbour towards you. 
Those who are critical will view your content to see or comment on just how horrible what you said was; others will (especially in matters of taboo and political correctness) see you as an underdog and become long-term customers.
This attention can even be appealing to those who don't make a living through social media; it's an easy way to get people to notice you, which feels good even if they're doing so for the wrong reasons.
As a result, a feedback loop is created: the critics are addicted to outrage, and the "comedians" are addicted to attention.

It is because of the above that I have not used any particular people or websites as case studies; directing more attention towards any particular figure will just worsen the problem.
But many people fail to realise this, and so the fad will likely continue to spread throughout social media like wildfire, burning up most meaningful discussion as well as all the reasons that shock humour could ever be considered funny.
Maybe people will eventually get bored of arguing and creating relatively tepid humour, finding something better to do with their time.
Or not.
I suppose we'll see.
