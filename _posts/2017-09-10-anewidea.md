Music is very fun.
Everyone likes music.
Well, most people do.
I like music too.
The issue there is that I haven't listened to a lot of it.
I need to explore and develop my tastes, and I thought (like most people nowadays) that I may as well share my journey online.

And when it comes to learning and exploring, what other place to start than at the beginning?
Or at least, the most solid point I can find to begin from.
That point is the Renaissance period in Western music.
From there, I will use online sources (aka Wikipedia) to locate and listen to notable artists and compositions.
If I find an interesting artist or style, I can then branch out and discover even more music.
By working my way forwards chronologically, I should (by the end of it) have a good list of artists that I am interested in.
There could also be opportunities to compose my own music in the style of the era/genre. 
That would be fun, wouldn't it?

Needless to say, once I have finished exploring an era or genre I will post a summary online describing its main features and artists.
If I end up describing any music theory, I'll try to explain it in as basic terms as possible.
Sorry if I end up confusing anyone.
(I've probably lost my non-existent readership already with these ramblings.)

Anyway, that's it.
See you after I've reviewed the Renaissance period, I guess.
